### 🌟 About Me

I’m passionate about transforming complex science into practical technology.  
Currently, I’m finishing my PhD in Physical Chemistry at Missouri University of Science and Technology, where I design software that helps scientists understand how molecules interact—even at distances too small to see.

My work sits at the intersection of physics, chemistry, math, and programming. I specialize in building tools (using MATLAB, C++, and Fortran) to model the “invisible forces” between molecules—essential for everything from advanced materials to environmental science.

- 🔬 **Research:** Molecular simulations & Potential Energy Surfaces  
- 💻 **Coding:** MATLAB, C++, Fortran, Python, and more  
- 🚀 **Skills:** Scientific computing, parallel programming, numerical methods  
- 🎓 **Background:** BSc in Physics (minors: Math & Chemistry), FIU  
- 🛠️ **Industry:** Former software engineer (web & device apps)
